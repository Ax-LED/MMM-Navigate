# MMM-Navigate
A module to connect a rotary encoder to MagicMirror and use it for Navigation inside of MagicMirror
I wanted to use interaction to the MagicMirror and decided to use a rotary encoder, which has 3 functions: Clockwise, Counterclockwise and Press.
These functions where combined to a navigation, so you have some possibilities, f.e.: Page increment/decrement, Newsfeed Article more/less details and actions for notification system.
The navigation fades out, if not used.

## Connect rotary encoder to raspberry pi
Using capacitors for CLK, DT and SW Pin can be useful for debouncing.

## Installing the module
Clone this repository in your `~/MagicMirror/modules/` folder `( $ cd ~MagicMirror/modules/ )`:
````javascript
git clone https://github.com/Ax-LED/MMM-Navigate
cd MMM-Navigate
npm install # this can take a while
````

## Using the module

To use this module, add it to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:
````javascript
{
	module: "MMM-Navigate",
	header: "Navigation",
	position: "top_left",
	config: {
			Alias: [
				'Seiten bl√§ttern',
				'News (mehr/weniger Details)',
				'Test notification',
				'News - mehr Details',
				'News - weniger Details',
				'Neustart MagicMirror (PM2)',
				'Neustart',
				'Herunterfahren'
			],
			Action: [
				[{notification:'PAGE_INCREMENT',payload:''},{notification:'PAGE_DECREMENT',payload:''}],//action array, first press locks menu, after this rotation CW/CCW executes, second press release lock mode
				[{notification:'ARTICLE_MORE_DETAILS',payload:''},{notification:'ARTICLE_LESS_DETAILS',payload:''}],
				{notification: 'SHOW_ALERT', payload: {type:'notification',message:'Dies ist eine Testnachricht'}},//single action, execute on press
				{notification:'ARTICLE_MORE_DETAILS',payload:''},
				{notification:'ARTICLE_LESS_DETAILS',payload:''},
				{notification: 'SHELLCOMMAND', payload:'pm2 restart mm'},
				{notification: 'SHELLCOMMAND', payload:'sudo reboot'},
				{notification: 'SHELLCOMMAND', payload:'sudo shutdown -h now'}
			],
			GPIOPins: [26,20,19]//rotary cw, rotary ccw, rotary press (BCM Numbering)
			},
},
````
On some Raspberry Pis it is neccesary to put the following line to /boot/config.txt for the GPIO where "rotary press (SW)" is connected:
````
gpio=19=ip,pu
````
<b>Background:</b> Sets your GPIO 19 as input (ip) and pull up (pu)
Change the entry according to the GPIO pin you use.


## Configuration options

The following properties can be configured:


<table width="100%">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Option</th>
			<th width="100%">Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><code>Alias</code></td>
			<td>An Array of the Alias for the navigation entries.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>Action</code></td>
			<td>An Array of Action of the Alias. There are two modes:<br>1. Execution of a single action, for Example <code>{notification:'PAGE_INCREMENT',payload:''}</code> to send page increment to MMM-Pages Module.<br>
			2. Execution of an array of action, as there are some actions, which belong together (like PAGE_INCREMENT and PAGE_DECREMENT), Example Config: <code>[{notification:'PAGE_INCREMENT',payload:''},{notification:'PAGE_DECREMENT',payload:''}]</code><br>
			Behavior: First press locks menu (can be identified by the red css frame), after this rotation CW/CCW executes actions from config, second press release lock mode so you can select another navigation entry.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>GPIOPins</code></td>
			<td>Array for Definition of GPIO-Pins (BMC) to connect the rotary encoder for the following actions: Clockwise, Counterclockwise and Press</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>SHELLCOMMAND</code></td>
			<td>Executes code in a terminal of you pi, so you can do almost everything you want. Example you want to shutdown your pi; Config: <code>
			{notification: 'SHELLCOMMAND', payload:'sudo shutdown -h now'}</code><br>
			</td>
		</tr>
   </table>
   Further information:<br>In version 1.1 of the module, i added a 'second click confirmation notification' for the following <code>SHELLCOMMAND</code>.<br>
   This means, if you are using SHELLCOMMAND and press the rotary, you get a notification to do a second press to execute the selected entry.

   ## Further options
   You can communicate with this module also by sending notifications.
   Examples:<br>
   <code>yourmmip:8080/MMM-Navigate/remote?action=NOTIFICATION&notification=CCW</code> emulates turning rotary counterclockwise<br>
   <code>yourmmip:8080/MMM-Navigate/remote?action=NOTIFICATION&notification=CW</code> emulates turning rotary clockwise<br>
   <code>yourmmip:8080/MMM-Navigate/remote?action=NOTIFICATION&notification=PRESSED</code> emulates pressing rotary encoder<br>
   <code>yourmmip:8080/MMM-Navigate/remote?notification=SHELLCOMMAND&action=sudo%20shutdown%20-h%20now</code> send command to shutdown your pi

   ## Version
   1.4 Changelog:
   - changed code for better recognition of the rotary encoder
   - changed code enables faster movement of the rotary
	
   1.3 Changelog:
   - added some functions to no longer have a dependency to MMM-Remote-Control
      - SHELLCOMMAND
	  - module is now listening to <code>yourmmip:8080/MMM-Navigate/remote?</code>

   1.2 Changelog:
   - added lock icon next to navigation alias, if locked
   - code cleaned
   
   1.1
   Changelog:
   - added ability to send notifications to MMM-Navigate by other modules
   - added locked mode, so you can put two(2) actions in one(1) navigation link which belong together (like PAGE_INCREMENT and PAGE_DECREMENT). More details see Configuration options (Action).
   - modified css, so locked mode is visual (red frame when locked) in MM
   - added second click confirmation notification for SHELLCOMMAND
   
   1.0 initial release
